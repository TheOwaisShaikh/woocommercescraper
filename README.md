# Web Scraping WooCommerce with Selenium and BeautifulSoup

Easily extract product details from a WooCommerce-based website leveraging the power of Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

🚀 Getting Started

🛠️ Prerequisites

Python: This script is designed for Python 3.x.
pip: Ensure pip is installed to manage Python packages.
Google Chrome: The script uses the ChromeDriver, so ensure you have Chrome installed.

🔧 Installation

Virtual Environment: Maintain a clean Python environment by setting up a virtual environment.

First, install virtualenv if it's not yet installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install virtualenv
Navigate to your project's directory:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/directory
Create and activate the virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .\venv\Scripts\activate
Install Required Libraries: With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install beautifulsoup4 pandas selenium webdriver_manager
📜 Running the Script
URLs Configuration: Ensure that the urls list in the script contains the WooCommerce website URLs you wish to scrape.

Execute the Script:

Navigate to the script's directory (if not already):

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/script/directory
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python script_name.py
📌 Don't forget to replace script_name.py with your actual script's filename.

Output: After successful execution, the extracted product details will be saved in a file named woocommerce_data.csv.

🧹 Cleanup
Once done, deactivate your virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
deactivate
